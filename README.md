## Introduction

This project demonstrates the basics of machine learning concepts using C. We start with creating single neurons and then proceed to more complex structures, such as double neurons and simple logic gates (OR, AND, NAND). Each implementation is modular, allowing for easy extension and experimentation with different gate combinations.

## Features

- **Single Neuron Implementation**: Build single neurons to understand the fundamentals of neuron processing.
- **Double Neuron Implementation**: Explore more complex neural structures with paired neurons.
- **Logic Gates**:
  - **OR Gate**: Allows logical OR operations.
  - **AND Gate**: Performs logical AND operations.
  - **NAND Gate**: Complements the AND gate.
  - **Compatibility Mode**: The OR gate implementation can be used with all other gates, providing a flexible model for testing various combinations.
